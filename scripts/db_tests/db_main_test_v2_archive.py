# Archive of previous db_main_test_v2.py (cleaned formatting)
# This is kept for reference; prefer `db_main_test_v3.py` for current testing.

# NOTE: the original v2 script was a collection of heuristics and many duplicated
# special-cases. For clarity we keep a reference here instead of the working copy.

# If you need to re-run older logic, consider porting only required parts into v3.
